    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gooseberry pie is a delightful dessert that showcases the tart and sweet flavors of fresh gooseberries. The pie
        typically features a buttery and flaky crust cradling a filling of juicy gooseberries, enhanced with sugar to
        balance the fruit's natural tartness. Some variations may include spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for added
        warmth.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3> PIE DOUGH</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups / 9oz / 255g - all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp - salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup / 170g/ 6oz- unsalted butter cold, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 - 1/2 cup - ice cold water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FILLING</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp - unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 cups / 32oz / 900g - gooseberries I used Cape Gooseberries, rinsed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup - granulated sugar or to taste</li>
        <li>zest of 1/2 lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li> <br>
        <li>Combine the flour, salt, and cold butter in a bowl and start to flatten and work the butter into the flour
            until the butter gets to the size of hazelnuts. Add just enough water to hold the dough together when
            squeezed in your hand. Split the dough in half and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30
            minutes.
        </li> <br>
        <li>In a saucepan, add the butter and heat until melted over medium heat. Add the gooseberries, sugar, and lemon
            zest. Cook for 10-15 minutes until some of the berries burst and the liquids thicken. If the berries are
            having a hard time bursting just smash a few with the back of a spoon. Let cool. If the liquid from the
            berries seem too thin, thicken it will a tsp of flour. I found that I didn't need to use it with my variety
            of gooseberry.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, roll one portion of the pie dough into a circle (about 1/8" thick). Place the dough into a
            lightly greased 9" pie pan. Gently press the edges into the pan. Prick a few holes with a fork to prevent
            the dough from bubbly in the oven.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Cover the dough with a sheet of parchment filled with baking beans. Bake for 15 minutes until lightly golden
            brown. Remove the baking beans and let cool. Meanwhile, roll the second portion of pie dough into a circle
            and refrigerate until needed.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Pour the cooked gooseberries into the prepared pie crust. Cover with the second pie round and press the
            edges in to seal the crust. You can either use a fork or your fingers to design the edges.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Cut 6 slits on the top of ventilation. You can use the dough scraps to write "Grumpy" on the top of pie like
            Snow White does in the movie. This is quite difficult but worth a try!
        </li> <br>
        <li>Brush with egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes until it is golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>
